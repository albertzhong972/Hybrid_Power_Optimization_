# Hybrid-Power-Optimization
ECEN 404 Senior Design - Hybrid Power Optimization

Project Description:
We are combining DC power from a solar panel with AC power from the grid to provide power to a load. We are using a PIC32MK microcontroller in this project.

There are four subsystems:
  -Power (Antonio)
  -PCB (Albert)
  -Software/Firmware (Eduardo)
  -Feedback (Heraclio)
  
  
  You can find our individual work as well as our progress reports in our own folders.
